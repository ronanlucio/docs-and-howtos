# Wireguard - Installation and Configuration

## INSTALL

**Ubuntu >= 19.10**
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
```

**Ubuntu <= 19.04**
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install wireguard
```

For other operational systems, visit the webpage below:

## PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS

### Generate private and public keys
```
$ sudo -i
$ wg genkey > /etc/wireguard/private
$ chmod 400 /etc/wireguard/private
$ wg pubkey < /etc/wireguard/private > /etc/wireguard/public
```


## CONFIGURATION

### Create a file named /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf with a content like following
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <YOUR PRIVATE KEY HERE>
Address = 192.168.200.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
#PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADEjk
#PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; ip6tables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT
SaveConfig = true
```

NOTE: Use PostUp and PostDown if you need to work with two interfaces and NAT

### If you're using firewall, you can set these rules:
```
$ sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
$ sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw status verbose
```


## START

### Start wireguard
```
$ sudo -i
# wg-quick up wg0
```

### Configure wireguard service to start on boot
```
$ sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```


## CHECK

### Check if vpn tunnel is running
```
$ sudo wg show
$ ifconfig wg0
```


## WIREGUARD CLIENT

The process for setting up a client is similar to setting up the server. When using Ubuntu as your client’s operating system, the only difference between the client and the server is the contents of the configuration file. If your client uses Ubuntu, follow the steps provided in the above sections and in this section.

### Generate private and public keys for the client
```
$ sudo -i
# wg genkey > /etc/wireguard/private
# chmod 400 /etc/wireguard/private
# wg pubkey < /etc/wireguard/private > ./wireguard/public
```

Create a file named /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf with a content like following
The main difference between the client and the server’s configuration file, wg0.conf, is it must contain its own IP addresses and does not contain the ListenPort, PostUP, PostDown, and SaveConfig values.
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Output of privatekey file that contains your private key>
Address = 192.168.200.2/24
```

### Connecting the Client and Server
There are two ways to add peer information to WireGuard; this guide will demonstrate both methods.

First, stop interface with sudo wg-quick down wg0 on both the client and the server

#### METHOD 1

The first method is to directly edit the client’s wg0.conf file with the server’s public key, public IP address, and port:
```
[Peer]
PublicKey = <Server Public key>
Endpoint = <Server Public IP>:51820
AllowedIPs = 192.168.200.0/24
```

Enable the wg service on both the client and server:
```
$ sudo wg-quick up wg0
$ sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```

#### METHOD 2

The second way of adding peer information is using the command line. This information will be added to the config file automatically because of the SaveConfig option specified in the Wireguard server’s configuration file.

Run the following command from the server. Replace the example IP addresses with those of the client:
```
$ sudo wg set wg0 peer <Client Public Key> endpoint <Client IP address>:51820 allowed-ips 203.0.113.12/24
```

Verify the connection:
```
$ sudo wg
```

This Peer section will be automatically added to wg0.conf when the service is restarted. If you would like to add this information immediately to the config file, you can run:
```
$ sudo wg-quick save wg0
```
