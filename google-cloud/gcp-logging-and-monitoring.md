# Google Cloud - Logging and Monitoring

## Stackdriver

GCP service that collects metrics, logs, and event data from applications and infrastructure and integrates the data so DevOps engineers can monitor, assess, and diagnose operational problems

## Monitoring

Extends the capabilities of Stackdriver by collecting performance data from GCP, AWS resources, and application instrumentation, including popular open source systems like nginx, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch

## Logging

This service enables users to store and analyze and alert on log data from both GCP and AWS logs

## Error Reporting

This aggregates application crash information for display in a centralized interface

## Trace

This is a distributed tracing service that captures latency data about an application to help identify performance problem areas

## Debugger

Enables developers to inspect the state of executing code, inject commands, and view call stack variables

## Profiler

This is used to collect CPU and memory utilization information across the call hierarchy of an application. Profiler uses statistical sampling to minimize the impact of profiling on application performance
