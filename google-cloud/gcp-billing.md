# Google Cloud - Billing

## Tracking costs of the instances

If you want to track costs automatically, you can enable Cloud Platform billing and setup Billing Export. This will produce daily reports on the usage and cost of VMs

## Cost of instance

Instance costs are based on machine-type. The more CPU and memory used, the higher the cost

VMs are charged for a minimum of 1 minute of use

Preemptible instances costs up to 80% less than nonpreemptible ones
